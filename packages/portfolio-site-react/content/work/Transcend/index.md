###### As a member of the Transcend Integrations team I:

- Build integrations to access and erase user data from platforms like Google Ads, Zendesk, Salesforce, and more.
- Help to build out data subject request (DSR) flows, including migrating them to be end-to-end encrypted and serverless.
- Work across the stack, building serverless functions, database migrations and mutations, and frontend components with React.
