# Harris' Portfolio Site

## Technology

The site is built using the react framework. Gatsby handles the static content management, rendering static HTML from markdown files. Animations are done using `react-spring` for a bit of flare. The application is optimized using Gatsby's internal image optimization libraries and lazy-loading of large imports, which allows the site to achieve a  time to interactive of 2.8 seconds. This, paired with the offline capabilites of `gatsby-plugin-offline`, allow the site to qualify as a Progressive Web App!
