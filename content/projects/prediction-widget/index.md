I worked on this project as part of my internship at [MagicLinks](https://magiclinks.com). The idea was to have a way for potential users (and current ones) to be able to predict how much income they could be making on the platform. I was in charge of the project from conception to completion, working both as the project and project manager.

- Deployed to an audience of 40,000 active users and even more potential users.

- Acted as both lead PDM and PJM to ideate new project idea with CEO and team leads, then executed on those ideas with a team of 5 developers

- Developed prediction algorithm using historical consumer data from the platform
