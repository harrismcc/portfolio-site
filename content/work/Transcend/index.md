###### As a member of the Transcend platform team, I:

- Create full stack features on our Admin Dashboard, like our new [dashboards view](https://transcend.io/blog/improving-privacy-program-visibility-with-transcend/).
- Resolve customer issues, bugs, and feature requests across the product.
- Work across the stack, building new API endpoints, database migrations and mutations, and frontend components/pages with React.
