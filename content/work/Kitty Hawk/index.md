Building powerful electric VTOL aircraft, and advanced AI to power them, [Kitty Hawk](https://kittyhawk.aero/) hopes to to create the next generation of vehicles for everyday flight. 

###### As a Software Engineering Intern I:

 - Remotely interviewed and joined the UPS team of the flyer project to develop software which monitored the system health of the vehicle in flight.
 - Used C++, Python and the ROS stack to develop software which interfaced between all of the different embedded devices within the flyer and a central linux flight computer.
